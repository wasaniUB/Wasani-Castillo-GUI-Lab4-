This lab focuses on advanced DOM manipulation and interactive UI behavior using JavaScript. It demonstrates event delegation by attaching single event listeners to parent elements and handling child interactions through event.target, along with the use of remove(), conatins(), closest(), and matches() for DOM traversal and element validation. The exercises include filtering content with data attributes, dynamically creating and removing elements, managing UI state through class manipulation (such as active, hidden, and editing), and implementing inline editing with keyboard and focus events. This lab reinforces practical front-end development patterns commonly used in dynamic web applications.
